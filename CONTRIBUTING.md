## Submitting Changes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project uses Conventional Commits. It is a specification that defines a consistent structure for commit messages and ensures a clear, machine-readable commit history. It is recommended that you [read the specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org), which also includes examples and an FAQ.

### Branch Workflow

Before contributing, make sure your fork is up to date by syncing it on GitHub and pulling the latest changes locally.
Create a new branch in your fork with a clear, descriptive name for the issue you are working on, then implement your changes.
Commit and push your work. Split your work into multiple commits if there are a lot of changes that conform to multiple Conventional Commit types.
Once everything is tested and working, open a pull reqeust and follow the guidelines mentioned below.

### Commit Messages

When writing a commit message, follow these conventions:
- Structure the message according to the Conventional Commits specification
- Use present tense: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- Use imperative mood: "Fix bug" not "Fixes bug"
- Keep first line under 72 characters
- Use the optional body to add detail or context if needed

### Pull Requests

When opening a pull request:
- Tag the related issue in the title using the correct format:
    ```
    GH-<issue-number>: Title

    Example:
    GH-37: Add auto-thread command
    ```
- Explain what you changed, why you changed it (if helpful), and note anything reviewers should pay attention to in particular
- Test your changes before submitting the pull request
